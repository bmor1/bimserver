#summary How to write Model merge plugins

= Introduction =

A model merge plugin basically provides the functionality to the BIMserver to merge 2 or more models. Merging has been made pluggable because merging  models is a hard problem in programming and requirements vary a lot.

= Details =

The plugin just has one method, which returns the actual ModelMerger instance.

{{{
public interface ModelMergerPlugin extends Plugin {
	ModelMerger createModelMerger();
}
}}}

The model merger instance looks like this:

{{{
public interface ModelMerger {
	IfcModelInterface merge(Project project, IfcModelSet modelSet, ModelHelper modelHelper) throws MergeException;
}
}}}
