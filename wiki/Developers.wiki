#summary Information for BIMserver developers.

Note: Updated for version 1.2

= Default user =

To speed up development, the BIMserver will (when running in your IDE by executing LocalDevBimServerStarter) create a default admin user with the username "admin@bimserver.org" and password "admin", also the SMTP server will be initialized with "localhost". On non-development machines the server will start in "SETUP" mode, meaning the user will see a page where he/she can setup the server including an admin user.
