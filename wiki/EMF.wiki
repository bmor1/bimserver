#summary Eclipse Modeling Framework.

= Introduction =

Building Information Models (BIM) are typically Object Oriented and tend to be large. For example the Industry Foundations Classes (IFC) have more than one thousand different classes. Because the BIMserver has been written in Java (an Object Oriented Language), it is very usefull to have actual Java classes in the used BIM model (for now, the BIMserver uses IFC internally), this is where the [http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/ Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)] comes into play.

= IFC Schema =

Most BIM meta models are described in a file format. As IFC is based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPRESS_(data_modeling_language) STEP/EXPRESS] technology, the schema is available as an .EXP file. This file has been converted to an [http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/emf/javadoc/2.6.0/org/eclipse/emf/ecore/package-summary.html#details EMF ECore] file with the [https://bimserver.googlecode.com/svn/branches/1.0/buildingSMARTLibrary BuildingSMARTLibrary] (part of BIMserver project).

= Generating Code =

The EMF framework generates Java classes with the given ECore file, these classes are used to store BIM models and passed to the [Database database layer].
