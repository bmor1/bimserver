#summary Design for object level modifications

[Issue http://code.google.com/p/bimserver/issues/detail?id=78]

= Introduction =

Until now the only way to change models in the BIMserver database would be to use the Service Interface (via SOAP for example) and upload new IFC files. Each file would become a new revision in the selected project.

Because IFC files tend to get very large, and usually only a fraction of the model has changed, it would be better to only send the actual changes instead of the complete new situation.

This page describes the planned implementation.

= Previous ideas / implementations =

A while ago there has been an implementation of ChangeSets, which were xml files describing the changes made with tags like "Addition", "Modification", "Removal".

We have also thought about using the IFC STEP format to describe changes, but because the IFC STEP format is meant for describing complete models it is impossible to reference objects not described in the file without breaking it (not confirming to the rules).
