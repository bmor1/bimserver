#summary Basic explanation of using the BIMserver SOAP interface

= Introduction =

External applications can interact with the BIMserver via SOAP (and [Interfaces other protocols]). For SOAP you need a WSDL file which describes all the methods/objects that are available. This BIMserver WSDL file can be found by running the BIMserver, logging in as an administrator via the webbased user interface, and going to Info | Web Services, see below.

With a WSDL file/url almost any programming language can generate code to make working with the SOAP service easier. For java developers we have created a project called "GeneratedClient" which can directly be used.

The BIMserver SOAP server is running on the same address/port as your web user interface, in most cases this will be 8082 (for a runnable JAR), 8080 for tomcat.

The WSDL file will give you the exact URL for the SOAP service, but it is always in the following format: http://[address of server]:[port of server]/soap. To get the WSDL file, append "?wsdl" to the URL.
