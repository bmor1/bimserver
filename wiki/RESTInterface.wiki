#summary Description of the REST-like interface

= Introduction =

Apart from the SOAP interface, a simple REST interface is available, this page describes how to use it.

= Authentication =
Authentication is done with Basic HTTP-auth (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

= Base URL =

The base url is:

{{{
http://[pathtobimserver:port]/rest
}}}

Adding `?_wadl` to the base URL will give you a WADL document describing the available services. Note: Even for getting the WADL document, authentication is required, you can use any valid BIMserver account.
