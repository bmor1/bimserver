#summary Description of the REST-like interface

= Introduction =

Apart from the SOAP interface, a simple REST interface is available, this page describes how to use it.

= Base URL =

The base url is:

{{{
http://[pathtobimserver]/rest
}}}

Adding `?_wadl` to the base URL will give you a WADL document describing the available services. Note: Even for getting the WADL document, authentication is required, you can use any valid BIMserver account.

= Available calls (examples) =

http://localhost:8082/rest/ping?in=test

Login call (required prior to most other calls)

http://localhost:8082/rest/login?username=[username]&password=[password]
