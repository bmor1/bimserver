#summary Design for the notifications system

= Introduction =

Certain software can benefit from notifications send by the BIMserver indicating for example new revisions added to projects.

= Possible triggers =

* New project/user/revisions/checkout
* Updated project/user/revision
* Deleted project/user
* Settings changed

= Implementation = 

* External software opens connection to the BIMserver
* Requests for notifications will be sent through the service interface
* BIMserver will send the actual notifications through Protocol Buffers
* External servers can use the service interface to get more information
* External servers will use a normal BIMserver user account
