#summary IFC Encoding

_Note: Updated for version 1.2_

= Introduction =

As of version 1.2, all types of STEP's String encoding are supported by the IfcStepSerializer and IfcStepDeserializer.

Also see [http://support.bimserver.org/bimserver/topics/make_bimserver_harmonize_string_encodings_in_a_bim_project?utm_content=reply_link&utm_medium=email&utm_source=reply_notification#reply_8132322]

Further development of the serializers/deserializers encoding/decoding depends on the availability of test files, so if you have problems with certain files, please contact us.

= Differences =
For certain characters, multiple different ways of encoding are possible in the STEP standard. BIMserver internally stores all string as UTF-8. BIMserver uses:
* For 32-126: ISO 8859-1
* For <255: ISO 10646 / ISO 8859-1 (the same for <255)
* The rest: UCS-2 or UCS-4, depending on the character

So in certain cases IFC files won't come out of the BIMserver the same as they went in.
