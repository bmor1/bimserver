#summary IFC Encoding

= Introduction =

Also see [http://support.bimserver.org/bimserver/topics/make_bimserver_harmonize_string_encodings_in_a_bim_project?utm_content=reply_link&utm_medium=email&utm_source=reply_notification#reply_8132322]

IFC strings are double encoded, for the file encoding/decoding UTF-8 is being used (which is also used in the BIMserver database)

The paragrapth numbers are referring to the documentation of ISO-10303-21, which I can't qoute here. 

6.3.3 Basic string stuff (Implemented)

6.3.3.1 ISO-8859  (Half implemented)

The first two paragraphs have been implemented, the third has not. ISO-8859-1 will be assumed when \S\ or \X\ is used.

The last part of page 11 desribes the use of 'reverse solidus capital letter P UPPER reverse solidus', followed by 'reverse solidus capital letter S reverse solidus' to indicate the ISO encoding standard to be used (ISO 8859-X) for the rest of the String, this has not been implemented.

6.3.3.2 ISO 10646 (Not implemented)

6.3.3.3 (Implemented)

Further development of the serializers/deserializers encoding/decoding depends on the availability of test files, so if you have problems with certain files, please contact us.
