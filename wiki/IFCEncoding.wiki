#summary IFC Encoding

= Introduction =

It's pretty complicated because as I see it, IFC strings are double encoded. I'll try to explain what you probably have concluded yourself, but I'll be posting this on the wiki as well. 

The paragrapth numbers are referring to the documentation of ISO-10303-21, which I can't qoute. 

6.3.3 Basic string stuff 
Implemented 

6.3.3.1 ISO-8859 
Not implemented 
The last part of page 11 desribes the use of 'reverse solidus capital letter P UPPER reverse solidus', followed by 'reverse solidus capital letter S reverse solidus' to indicate the ISO encoding standard to be used (ISO 8859-X) for the rest of the String, of which http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_... seems to support Nordic countries letters. 

6.3.3.2 ISO 10646 
Not implemented 

6.3.3.3 
Implemented 

If you can provide a set of IFC files using one of the unimplemented techniques I'll be happy to have a look at it, but without them I can't test it.
