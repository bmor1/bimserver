= Introduction =

Some issues are hard/impossible to fix, therefore we mention them here.

= Paths =
Because the BIMserver is starting separate processes for the IFCEngine (used for generating geometry and clasdetection), paths are a peculiar (and operating system based) thing.
For windows:
- Paths can contain spaces, but not multiple spaces together:
  * Right: "C:\Program Files\BIMserver 1.0"
  * Wrong: "C:\Program Files\BIMserver  1.0"
For OSX:
  * Paths cannot contain any spaces at all
For linux:
  * Paths cannot contain any spaces at all
