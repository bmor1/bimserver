= Introduction =

Some issues are hard/impossible to fix, therefore we mention them here.

= Paths =
Because the BIMserver is starting separate processes for the IFCEngine (used for generating geometry and clasdetection), paths are a peculiar (and operating system based) thing.
For windows:
- Paths can contain spaces, but not multiple spaces together:
  * Right: "C:\Program Files\BIMserver 1.0"
  * Wrong: "C:\Program Files\BIMserver  1.0"
For OSX:
  * Paths cannot contain any spaces at all
For linux:
  * Paths cannot contain any spaces at all

= Inverses =

IFC has the notion of "inverse" relations. EMF has the notion of "opposites", where possible those have been mapped, but it's not always possible so sometimes "inverses" won't work the way you would think.

The problem with inverses in IFC is that one can be defined on class "A", referencing a certain field of type "B" which in turn does not point to the field of type "A", but to a field on a supertype of "A". EMF does not support these kind of opposites.
