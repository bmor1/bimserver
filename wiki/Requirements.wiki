= Introduction =

The amount of required heap memory depends on the size of your models. A rule of thumb is that you need about 15 times the size of the largest (unzipped) IFC file you want to be able to upload. You can find more information [MemoryUsage here].

You can download a JRE or JDK [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html here].

For advanced queries you will need to use a JDK, for all other features a JRE will suffice.

= WAR =

  * A JRE or JDK 6, update 4 or higher
  * A Servlet Specification 3.0 or higher based Container (Tomcat 7 or higher, Jetty 8 or higher)

= JAR =
  * A JRE or JDK 6, update 4 or higher

Explanation:
  * A JRE or JDK version 6 update 4 or higher is required because the BIMserver makes extensive use of JAXB 2.1.3, which only JREs and JDKs after update 4 have a reference implementation of
  * In the Servlet Specification 2.5, a methed called getContextPath was added to the ServletContext class, the BIMserver uses this method, so therefore your servlet container must at least support version 2.5 of the servlet specification
