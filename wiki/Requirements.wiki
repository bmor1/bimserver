#summary This page describes the requirements of your system to run a BIMserver

= Introduction =

Requirements

= WAR =

  * A JRE or JDK 6, update 4 or higher
  * A Servlet Specification 2.5 or higher based Container (Tomcat 6 or higher, Jetty 6 or higher)

= JAR =
  * A JRE or JDK 6, update 4 or higher

Explenation:
  * A JRE or JDK version 6 update 4 or higher is required because the BIMserver makes extensive use of JAXB 2.1.3, which only JREs and JDKs after update 4 have a reference implementation
  * In the Servlet Specification 2.5, a methed called getContextPath was added to the ServletContext class, the BIMserver uses this method, so therefore your servlet container must at least support version 2.5 of the servlet specification
