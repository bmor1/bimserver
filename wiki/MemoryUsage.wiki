#summary A few notes about memory usage

= Introduction =

The BIMserver uses quite some memory, this page will explain how it's used.

= BerkeleyDB Cache =

BerkeleyDB (the database engine the BIMserver uses) has a setting for the amount of heap memory it can use for caching (which will speedup reads), we have set it to 25%. So if you give your BIMserver 4GB of heap, it will soon be using 1GB of memory for caching.

See [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17277_02/html/java/com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentMutableConfig.html#setCachePercent(int) the BerkeleyDB documentation] for more information
