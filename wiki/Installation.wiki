#summary How to install or run your own BIMserver
#labels Deploy,UserSupport

= Introduction =

The BIMserver comes in two different versions, both are functionally the same:

  * The JAR build: Easier to install, meant to be run on a desktop/laptop computer to try/test the software
  * The WAR build: A bit harder to install, meant to be run on a server computer

= JAR =

A JAR file can directly be executed on most operating systems.

  # Make sure you have a recent version of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK), a JRE can be downloaded here http://java.com.
  # Download the latest JAR build from http://download.bimserver.org/
  # Some browsers rename the JAR file, make sure it ends with ".jar"
  # Start the program by double clicking, you should see the following window:
http://bimserver.googlecode.com/svn/images/jar.png
  # Normally you wont have to change any settings and you can simply start the BIMserver by clicking "Start"

_Note for OSX users
You can change the default JVM under Applications | Utilities | Java Preferences, on some OSX installations this somehow defaults to Java 5 where the BIMserver needs version 6._

||Settings||Meaning||
||JVM||Allows for a JVM other than the default JVM to be selected||
||Address||The address the server will be binding on, if you want the BIMserver to be available on other machines than your own, you will have to change this to a real IP address||
||Port||The port must be free, and the firewall must be configured to allow listening on this port||
||Heap size||The amount of heap memory appointed to the instance JVM of the BIMserver, more heap means larger models can be stored/retrieved. The amount of heap is limited by the amount of memory available on your machine, but be sure to always save a few hundred of MB's to your OS and other applications. On 32-bit Windows computers, the limit is around 1500MB||
||Stack size||The amount of stack size available for every thread, you are probably not ever going to need more than 2MB. With a stack size that is too low, you will probably be getting StackOverflowError messages||

= WAR =


= Settings =

The settings page is the same for the JAR and WAR builds. You can get to the settings screen by logging on to the web interface as an Administrator and clicking "Settings" in the top right corner of the screen.

Only the SMTP server setting is required for full functionality, in most cases where e-mail is not working, this has not been set.
