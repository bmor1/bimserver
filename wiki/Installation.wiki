#summary How to install or run your own BIMserver
#labels Deploy,UserSupport

_Note: Updated for version 1.2_

= Introduction =

The BIMserver comes in two different versions, both are functionally the same:

  * The JAR build: Easier to install, meant to be run on a desktop/laptop computer to try/test the software
  * The WAR build: A bit harder to install, meant to be run on a server computer

= JAR =

A JAR file can directly be executed on most operating systems.

Note: Make sure you do not put the .jar file in C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86) because Windows plays funky tricks with those directories [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VistasShowCompatibilityFilesAndTheScrumptiousWonderThatIsFileVirtualization.aspx]

  # Make sure you have a recent version of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK), a JRE can be downloaded here http://java.com.
  # Download the latest JAR build from http://download.bimserver.org/
  # Some browsers rename the JAR file, make sure it ends with ".jar"
  # Start the program by double clicking, you should see the following window:

  # Normally you wont have to change any settings and you can simply start the BIMserver by clicking "Start"

_Note for OSX users: You can change the default JVM under Applications | Utilities | Java Preferences, on some OSX installations this somehow defaults to Java 5 where the BIMserver needs version 6._

||Settings||Meaning||
||JVM||Allows for a JVM other than the default JVM to be selected||
||Home directory||Location of the home directory, this is where the database, log files etc... are stored||
||Address||The address the server will be binding on, if you want the BIMserver to be available on other machines than your own, you will have to change this to a real IP address||
||Port||The port must be free, and the firewall must be configured to allow listening on this port||
||Max heap size||The amount of heap memory appointed to the instance JVM of the BIMserver, more heap means larger models can be stored/retrieved. The amount of heap is limited by the amount of memory available on your machine, but be sure to always save a few hundred of MB's to your OS and other applications. On 32-bit Windows computers, the limit is around 1500MB||
||Max Perm Size||256MB should be enough, if you are deploying a lot of plugins you might need more||
||Stack size||The amount of stack size available for every thread, you are probably not ever going to need more than 2MB. With a stack size that is too low, you will probably be getting StackOverflowError messages||

= WAR =

Copy the .war file to the appropriate place in you application server.
