#summary Protocol Buffers interface

= Introduction =

As the BIMserver's main function is to allow other software to store and retrieve information about building information models, it is very important to support a wide variety of programming language. From the beginning of the BIMserver project a SOAP interface has been available, but SOAP has a few disadvantages being:
  * SOAP is XML based, which makes it slower/larger
  * Almost every SOAP stack interprets the standards a little different
  * A lot of diversions/extensions are available, making it almost not a standard

For these reasons another interface has been implemented: [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ Protocol Buffers].

The Protocol Buffers API has been created on top of the "Service Interface", so the actual calls will not be described in this document.
