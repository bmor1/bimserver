#summary How to use eclipse for BIMserver development

_Updated for v1.2 on 07-01-2013_

= Introduction =

The BIMserver has been developed with the Eclipse IDE. Of course all code is standard Java code, so any IDE should work. Using Eclipse has the advantage of being able to check out complete projects with all dependencies set.

= Checking out =

All code is stored in google code's subversion. So after installing Eclipse (the latest version as of this writing is 4.2 or Juno), you will need to install a subversion client, the two most used are Subversive and Subclipse. After installing on of those you have to select a repository, the URL is: http://bimserver.googlecode.com/svn. You can login anonymously or use a google code username/password, use that if you want to commit code (beware to use httpS and a generated password if you want to commit; see http://code.google.com/p/bimserver/source/checkout for more info).

You can choose to start with the latest version ("/trunk"), or use a branch of a stable version ("/branches/1.0" or "/branches/1.1" at the time of writing). Select all projects and rights-click and select "Check Out".

= Note =

Somehow a strange bug in Eclipse will give compile errors after checking out all projects. The only known work around to fix this is the following:

 * Go to Window | Preferences
 * Go to Java | Installed JREs
 * Uncheck the selected JRE
 * Check it again
 * Wait till Eclipse is done compiling
 * Now there should be no compile errors anymore

Note2: Sometimes restarting eclipse apparently fixes things too.

= Running the BIMserver without Web Interface =

To run the BIMserver from eclipse, right click the BimServer project, select "Run As" and then "Java Application", eclipse will look for classes with main methods, you have to select "LocalDevBimServerStarter", which is in the package "org.bimserver".
