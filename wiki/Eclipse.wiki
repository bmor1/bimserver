#summary How to use eclipse for BIMserver development

= Introduction =

The BIMserver has been developed with the Eclipse IDE, of course all code is standard Java code, so any IDE would work, but using Eclipse has the advantages of being able to check out complete projects with dependencies all set.

= Checking out =

All code is stored in google code's subversion. So after installing Eclipse (the latest version as of this writing is 3.6 or Helios), you will need to install a subversion client, the two most used are Subversive and Subclipse. After installing those you have to select a repository, the URL is: https://bimserver.googlecode.com/svn. You can login anonymously or use a google code username/password, use that if you want to commit code.

You can choose to start with the latest version ("/trunk"), or use a branch of a stable version ("/branches/1.0" at the time of writing). Select all projects and rights-click and select "Check Out".

= Note =

Somehow a strange bug in Eclipse will give compile errors after checking out all projects. The only work around found to fix this is the following:

 * Go to Window | Preferences
 * Go to Java | Installed JREs
 * Add another JRE/JDK if you not already have more than 1
 * Switch to another JRE/JDK and click OK
 * Wait till Eclipse is done compiling
 * Now there should be no compile errors anymore
 * [Optional] switch back to your original JRE/JDK
