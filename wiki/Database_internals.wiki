#summary Internal workings of the database.

= Introduction =

The BIMserver is storing all data in a key-value store, this key-value can be changed in code, but the only implementation right now is in the open source BerkeleyDB Java Edition (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index-093405.html).

A key value store is defined as:
* A set of named tables
* Each table has 2 columns, key and value
* Both the key and value column can contain an arbitrarily sized byte array, this size may vary per record
* All keys in a table are always ordered
* No duplicate keys can exist

= Details =

Each record in a table has the following layout:

|Key|Value|
|Pid (4 bytes) + Oid (8 bytes) + Rid (8 bytes)||
